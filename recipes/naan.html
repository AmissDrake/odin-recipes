    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Naan (pronounced nahn) is an oven-baked, leavened bread that is stuffed and flavored in a variety of ways. An essential part of South and Central Asian cuisine,
         naan is easy, affordable, and makes the most of pantry ingredients you already have on hand.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 (.25 ounce) package active dry yeast</li>
        <li>1 cup warm water</li>
        <li>¼ cup white sugar</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons milk</li>
        <li>1 large egg, beaten</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons salt</li>
        <li>4 ½ cups bread flour</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons minced garlic (Optional)</li>
        <li>¼ cup butter, melted</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li><h3>Step 1</h3>  Dissolve yeast in warm water in a large bowl. Let stand about 10 minutes, until frothy.

        <li><h3>Step 2</h3>  Meanwhile, generously oil a large bowl. 
            </li>
        <li><h3>Step 3</h3>Stir sugar, milk, egg, and salt into the yeast mixture. Mix in enough flour to make a soft dough.

        <li><h3>Step 4</h3> Knead dough on a lightly floured surface until smooth, 6 to 8 minutes.

        <li><h3>Step 5</h3> Place dough in the prepared oil, cover with a damp cloth, and let rise until doubled in size, about 1 hour.

        <li><h3>Step 6</h3>  Punch down dough on a lightly floured surface, and knead in garlic. Pinch off small handfuls of dough about the size of a golf ball; you should have about 14. 
            Roll each piece into a ball and place on a tray. Cover with a towel, and allow to rise until doubled in size, about 30 minutes. 
            </li><img src="../images/naan/Step6.webp" height="300" width="400">
        <li><h3>Step 7</h3>   Meanwhile, preheat a large grill pan over high heat. 
            </li>
        <li><h3>Step 8</h3>  Roll each piece of dough into a thin circle. 
            </li><img src="../images/naan/Step8.webp" height="300" width="400">
        <li><h3>Step 9</h3>   Brush some melted butter on the preheated grill pan. Place a few pieces of dough in the pan (as many as you can fit) and cook until puffy and lightly browned, 2 to 3 minutes.
             Brush butter onto the uncooked sides, flip, and cook until browned, 2 to 4 more minutes. Remove from the grill and repeat to cook the remaining naan. 
            </li><img src="../images/naan/Step9.webp" height="300" width="400">  
        <li><h3>Step 10</h3>  Enjoy!

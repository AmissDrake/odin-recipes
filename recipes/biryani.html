    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li><h3>Step 1</h3>  Gather all ingredients.  
            </li><img src="../images/chickenbiryani/Step1.webp" height="300" width="400">
        <li><h3>Step 2</h3> Heat 2 tablespoons of oil in a large skillet. Fry potatoes in hot oil until lightly browned, 
            about 3 to 5 minutes. Remove to a paper towel-lined plate to drain; set aside. 
            </li><img src="../images/chickenbiryani/Step2.webp" height="300" width="400">
        <li><h3>Step 3</h3> Add remaining 2 tablespoons of oil to the skillet. Add onions, garlic, and fresh ginger; cook and stir until onion is soft and golden.
             Add tomatoes, salt, cumin, chili powder, pepper, and turmeric; cook, stirring constantly, for 5 minutes.  
            </li><img src="../images/chickenbiryani/Step3.webp" height="300" width="400">
        <li><h3>Step 4</h3>  Stir in yogurt, mint, ground cardamom, and cinnamon stick. Cover and cook over low heat, stirring occasionally, until tomatoes are cooked 
            to a pulp. It may be necessary to add a little hot water if mixture becomes too dry and starts to stick to the pan. 
            </li><img src="../images/chickenbiryani/Step4.webp" height="300" width="400">
        <li><h3>Step 5</h3> Add chicken and stir well to coat. Cover and cook over very low heat until chicken is tender, 35 to 45 minutes. There should only be a little 
            very thick gravy left when chicken is finished cooking. If necessary cook uncovered for a few minutes to reduce the gravy.

        <li><h3>Step 6</h3> Meanwhile, make the rice: Wash rice well and drain in a colander for at least 30 minutes.
